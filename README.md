Welcome to my homelab where I host useful services and websites. Previously I 
used Docker to run all the software but next realised that it uses too much
resources of the Raspberry Pi so instead of running Apache HTTP Server inside
the container decided to install the `apache2` service. This works much better. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To make everything up and running you don't need to have a PhD in computer 
science, what you need is just a computer where Ansible will run and the 
Raspberry Pi which will run all the workloads. 

First of all, you need to install Ansible on the main computer, `brew` is a good
way to do so: 

```shell
brew install ansible
```

> **Important!** If you need to login to multiple remote computer no need 
to generate keys for each of them, the same key can be used. 

The next step is to generate the SSH key that will be used to access
the Raspberry Pi without need to enter the password: 

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Raspberry Pi"
```

When the key is generated, it is saved to the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and needs to be
copied to the Raspberry Pi. Execute the following command to do so: 

```shell
ssh-copy-id abarmin@barmin-home.local
```

You will be asked to enter the password for the user with name `abarmin`, 
ussing it exists. 

Execute the following command to test, you should be logged without in the need
to enter the password: 

```shell
ssh abarmin@barmin-home.local
```

To perform many operations it's necessary to have `root` privileges. Use `-K`
parameter to the `ansible-playbook`. 

The next step is to make Ansible aware of the host and to do so it's necessary
to create an [`inventory.yml`](./ansible/inventory.yml) file which contains
all the details on how to connect to the Raspberry Pi: 

```yml
all:
  hosts:
    raspberrypi:
      ansible_host: barmin-home.local
      ansible_user: abarmin
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Execute the following command to check the connection: 

```shell
ansible all -i ./ansible/inventory.yml -m ping
```

There should be no errors in the output. 

The last one step is to apply the [`playbook.yml`](./ansible/playbook.yml) that
installs all the necessary software.

```shell
ansible-playbook -i ./ansible/inventory.yml ./ansible/playbook.yml
```

Or, it's better to execute [`apply.sh`](./ansible/apply.sh) as it also
automatically checks if all the necessary environment variables are set.

As a result, all the necessary services wil be automatically installed, all 
the required directories are created and the Pi is ready to go. 

## üíº Services

### üì¶ Core Services

Ansible automatically installes the following services: 

* Apache HTTP Server + PHP module
* MariaDB as a drop-in replacement for the MySQL
* phpMyAdmin for managing MariaDB databases
* Tomcat 10 + JDK 17 for running Java apps
* üìö Nextcloud [hub.barmin-home.local](http://hub.barmin-home.local)
* üêû Mantis Bugtracker [bt.abarmin.pro](https://bt.abarmin.pro)
* üë®‚Äçüíª Personal website [abarmin.pro](https://old.abarmin.pro)

## ü§ê Secrets

To make the installation process working, it's necessary to add the Cloudflare
tunnel secret before executing the [`apply.sh`](./ansible/apply.sh) script. 

```shell
export CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="<Cloudflare Tunnel Token>"
```

## üôã How to 

## Add HEIC support to NextCloud

1. Make sure ImageMagick extension is installed (should be installed automatically) 
  by Ansible but just in case you're doing the installation manually. 
2. Add the following lines to the `config/config.php` file: 

```php
  'enabledPreviewProviders' =>
    array (
      0 => 'OC\\Preview\\BMP',
      1 => 'OC\\Preview\\GIF',
      2 => 'OC\\Preview\\JPEG',
      3 => 'OC\\Preview\\Krita',
      4 => 'OC\\Preview\\MarkDown',
      5 => 'OC\\Preview\\MP3',
      6 => 'OC\\Preview\\OpenDocument',
      7 => 'OC\\Preview\\PNG',
      8 => 'OC\\Preview\\TXT',
      9 => 'OC\\Preview\\XBitmap',
      10 => 'OC\\Preview\\HEIC',
      11 => 'OC\\Preview\\Movie',
    ),
```

If previews for HEIC files aren't generated, execute the following: 

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/libheif
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrate
sudo apt install libheic
```

## Register manually uploaded files to NextCloud

It's much quicker to upload files by using SFTP rather than NextCloud's WebDav. 
But the files loaded manually will not appear on NextCloud because it's necessary
to register them first. Can be done by scanning: 

```shell
sudo -u www-data php occ files:scan --all
```

Will take some time but next these files will appear in the UI too. 

## Group preview generation

After uploading of multiple files it's better to generate previews for all of them. 
To do so need to install `Preview Generator` app and execute: 

```shell
sudo -u www-data php occ preview:generate-all
```

It'll take some time but the progress will be shown in the terminal. 

## Use Imeginary to generate previews for various image types

Recently added the `golang` and `imaginary` roles. The first one installs
the `go` executable, the second one installs a high-performance image library
[imaginary](https://github.com/h2non/imaginary). The library provides with 
a service that listens to `28080` port and converts images. 

To use it add the following line to the `nextcloud/config/config.php`:

```
'preview_imaginary_url' => 'http://localhost:28088/',
```

And enable a corresponding preview provider: 

```php
 'enabledPreviewProviders' => array(
  ..
  12 => 'OC\\Preview\\Imaginary'
 )
```

## Change `tmux` color theme

`tmux` is one of my favourite tools and it's important to have different
color scheme on different environments - otherwise it's too easy to make
wrong action on the wrong environment. 

First of all, it's [awesome tmux](https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tmux)
which has a lot of useful tools that will make life much better. 

Secondly, configuration for tmux actually lives in `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`
but not in `~/.tmux.conf` as it's mentioned everywhere on the web. 

## Create `zfs` RAID1

Surprisingly, it's not that hard as it sounded. First, need to install `zfs`
kernel module (`nas` roles does it automatically but just in case):

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
```

Next, check that `zfs` module is up and running: 

```shell
lsmod | grep zfs
```

If not visible, load it: 

```shell
sudo modprobe zfs
```

> My drives were used as `mdadm` RAIS so need to exclude it from RAID first
  and wipe out the file system: 

  ```shell
  # Get name of the raid
  lsblk

  # Stop the mdadm raid
  sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md127

  # Zero superblock
  sudo mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdx

  # Remove the file system
  sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdx
  ```

Finally, when disks are prepared, create a ZFS pool: 

```shell
sudo zpool create tank mirror /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
```

And a file system on top of it: 

```shell
sudo zfs create /tank/nas
```

Good idea is to enable the compression: 

```shell
sudo zfs set compression=lz4 tank
```

Don't forget to change owner of the mount point: 

```shell
sudo chown abarmin:abarmin /tank/nas
```

## Import a big MySQL dump

Surprisingly, it's simple: 

```shell
mysql -u username -p database_name < dump.sql
```

`root` user should work too :)
